Installing Mongo PHP module
	Access MongoDB from PHP
	To access MongoDB from PHP you need:

	The MongoDB server running. The server is the “mongod” file, not the “mongo” client (note the “d” at the end).
	The MongoDB PHP driver installed.
	Install the PHP Driver
	*NIX
	Run:

	sudo pecl install mongo
	Open your php.ini file and add to it:

	extension=mongo.so
	It is recommended to add this to the section with the other “extensions,” but it will work from anywhere within the php.ini file.

	Restart your web server (Apache, nginx, etc.) for the change to take effect.

	See the installation docs for configuration information and OS-specific installation instructions.

	Note pecl requires that pear be installed. For those using apt-get, you may need to run the following:
	sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-cli php-pear
	Windows
	Download the correct driver for your environment from <https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivers.mongodb.org/php/index.html>. Thread safe builds are used when running PHP as an Apache module (typical installation); non-thread safe builds, which include “nts” in the filename, are used for CGI.
	Unzip and add the appropriate php_mongo.dll file to your PHP extensions directory (usually the ext folder in your PHP installation).
	Add to your php.ini:
	extension=php_mongo.dll
	Restart your web server (Apache, IIS, etc.) for the change to take effect.
	For more information, see the Windows section of the installation docs.
